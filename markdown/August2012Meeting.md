# rosettacode.org chrestomathy review

We will review some of the examples from rosettacode.org, with a focus on Perl 6 (and Perl 5), but may also compare to some of the other language examples.

Please volunteer to pick an example or two to review.  Just look for something with a Perl 6 implementation and be prepared to talk us through the problem statement and how the Perl 6 solution works.

Agenda:

* your name here - problem link
* Eric - [Sum Digits of an Integer](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sum_digits_of_an_integer)
* Igal - [99 Bottles of Beer](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer)
* Anthony - [n-onacci](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fibonacci_n-step_number_sequences#Perl_6)

* you - [Strand Sort](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms/Strand_sort) - from Larry's state of the onion
