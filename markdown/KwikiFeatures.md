The overall design goal of CGI::Kwiki is _simplicity_ and _extensibility_.

Even so, Kwiki will have some killer builtin features not available in most wikis:

* [[KwikiPrivacy]]
* [[KwikiSlideShow]]
* [[KwikiBlog]]
* [[KwikiSisters]]
* [[KwikiHotKeys]]
* [[KwikiFit]]
* [[KwikiPod]]

Each feature is implemented as a separate plugin class. This keeps things _simple_ and _extensible_.
