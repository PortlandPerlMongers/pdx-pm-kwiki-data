Rob Buels is a technical lead / programmer / analyst / dungeon master at the [Sol Genomics Network](http://solgenomics.net).

He's active in the [GMOD project](http://gmod.org), an umbrella organization for open-source projects for model organism databases.  He contributes code where he can, but mostly lately he's feverishly working to clean up and release as open source most of the code that runs http://solgenomics.net.
