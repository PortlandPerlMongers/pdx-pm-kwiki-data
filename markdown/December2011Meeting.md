Acmeism (http://acmeism.org

Pegex is an Acmeist parsing language. Think of it as Perl 6 Rules and Regexp::Grammars for all programmers. Write One Grammar, Parse Everywhere. This makes Pegex the quintessential tool in the Acmeist's belt. Pegex.pm is fully functional in Perl 5, and working its way across the Acmeist landscape.
Come see Ingy döt Net (an inventor of YAML and the father of Acmeism) talk about Pegex and the exciting future of Acmeism.
