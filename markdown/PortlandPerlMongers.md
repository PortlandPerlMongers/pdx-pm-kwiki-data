# Monthly Meeting

PDX.pm meetings are on the second Thursday of each month at 6:53pm, typically at [Free Geek](http://freegeek.org/).  Meetings are free-of-charge for all [PortlandPerlMongerMembers](/PortlandPerlMongerMembers).  The cost for non-members is $2,000,000,000.00 per person.

Membership is free and open to everyone on a self-serve basis.  Just join the [MailingList](/MailingList) or add yourself to the members page, come to meetings, and have fun.

See the [FutureMeetings](/FutureMeetings) page for upcoming meetings.

## Yes, this is a wiki

But some bots can't play nice, so some pages (like this one) are locked.
