Hi, I'm Chris Dawson.  Please, no [Dawson's Creek](http://dawsonscreek.com/) cracks; your jokes are so old they are in syndication too!

I started [Webcast in a Box](http://webcastinabox.com) with my friend Erik Herz in October of 2003.  The Webcast in a Box appliance is an extremely simple to use broadcasting product.  Just stick in a USB key and you are broadcasting live video on the internet.  Almost every piece of management software I wrote for the Webcast in a Box appliance is written in Perl.

I have worked for Claris Corporation (in and out of Apple Computer for many years), RealNetworks, and Virage which was recently acquired by Autonomy.

I published the [Smil.pm](http://webiphany.com/perlysmil) on [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~cdawson/Smil-0.861/Smil.pm) several years ago.  Smil.pm is a perl module for generating Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language files, which are multimedia formatting language files which can be processed by software like the RealPlayer.
