## Portland Perl Projects

This page comes from the "Help Wanted" idea that
Ovid inspired one late night in September at the [LuckyLab](/LuckyLab).

Some people have tuits or want to learn, but don't know where to start.
Some people have great ideas but little/no time.
Some people don't have ideas or time but like to kibitz.

Let's get together, collaborate, test, code, and release Portland code upon an unsuspecting world!

### Project Ideas:

* [ProjectEulerChallenge](/ProjectEulerChallenge)
* [gabrielle](/gabrielle): uhhh update our website
* [JonathanLeto](/JonathanLeto): [CodeSprints](/CodeSprints) to put PDX.pm ON THE MAP.
