(Shouldn't that cmp be a <=>? -- [AndyLester](/AndyLester))
(And that's a poor use of the ST, since "length" is a fast function -- [RandalSchwartz](/RandalSchwartz))

[RandallHansen](/RandallHansen):
(Yes, that's Perl in the background.  It's 3 colors but can be reduced to 2 if necessary.  At full size it reads pretty well; I'll bring a print to the meeting.)
