What does [FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh) (the leader of the pdx.pm) do?  Here are the duties.

Even though we have a leader, the current [FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh) would like to keep this page here as a cheatsheet.

---

* manage finding/playing video (You)

  * This task really consists of picking a video from the list of [MeetingVideos](/MeetingVideos) (or finding your own) and having a laptop that can play the video on the projector.  Having speakers on your laptop is good, too.  This could be something that is a rotating job.

* future meetings ([FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh))

  * Usually involves finding someone who is interested in talking to the group.  We now have the [FutureMeetings](/FutureMeetings) page to assist with this job.

* sending reminder emails ([FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh))

  * send emails reminding people that the meeting is happening.  A good format has been the week before, a couple of days before, and the day of.

* manage list ([HelpWanted](/HelpWanted))

  * If you can use [Mailman](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html), then you can do this.

* receiving email ([FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh))

  * O'Reilly and Apress like to send us stuff, usually in the form of emails, which this person would send on to the group.

* intro to meetings ([FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh))

  * Stand up, introduce the group, let people know where the bathroom is, talk about the meeting topic, thank the speaker when they're done, ask for announcements, and point everyone towards beer.

* juggle books ([GabrielleRoth](/GabrielleRoth))

  * We have about 15 books in the [Library](/Library).  They get shipped to us by O'Reilly and Apress (see receiving email), and then handed out to people.  We should keep track of what books we have and who has which book on the wiki.

* t-shirts ([FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh))

  * see [ShirtNotes](/ShirtNotes)

* executive decisions ([FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh))

  * We moved the meeting to the Rose and Raindrop once.  That's about it.

* secure a meeting location ([FearlessJosh](/FearlessJosh))

  * Unless [FreeGeek](/FreeGeek) stops being a good place to meet, this isn't really a job anymore.

* move website ([HelpWanted](/HelpWanted))

  * This is a one-time issue, but we need to move the website from it's current location (being hosted by an ex-member) to a new one.  Finding the new location is an important first step.

* fliers/promo stuff ([HelpWanted](/HelpWanted))

  * There was a discussion on the list about slipping bookmarks into some of the Perl tomes at Powells Tech.
