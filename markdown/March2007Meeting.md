## A Small Smalltalk Talk

Rik Smoody of [smOOdynamics](http://smoo.com) presented various aspects of Smalltalk, including:

* Test-Driven Development the Squeak way
* Seaside (web framework from which Jifty has stolen many ideas)
* It's Objects all the way down

There is a podcast, but it is currently suffering from having been recorded too close to the projector fan...  Perhaps it will appear on the [podcast page](http://pdxpm.podasp.com).
